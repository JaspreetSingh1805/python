How do you create a list in Python? How is it different from a tuple? 
List : Mutable(Elements can change)
tuple: Imutable (Elements cannot change)
List: list creating using [] square braquets
tuple: tuple creating using ()parenthis

(qoe-2) Explain the difference between == and is in Python.
(Ans-2) The ==operator checks the value equality it compares the value of two object to determine if they are equal
The (is) operator checks the identity equality. it determine whether two references point  to the same object in memory

(que-3) What are loops in Python? Explain the difference between for and while loops.
for loop => The `for`loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like list,tuple, string or range) it automatically goes through each item in the sequence and execute the loop body for each item.
for example
for variable in sequence:
    # code block to execute
While loop => the `while` loop repeatedly execute a block of a code a long as the given condition is true it is typically used when the number of iteration is not known beforehead
for example 
count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1
(que -4) What is a dictionary in Python, and how do you access elements from it?
(Ans-4) A Dictionary in python is unordered, mutable collection of key value pairs Each key in a dictionary 
student = {

    "name = "john"
    "age" = 21
    "major" = "Computer science"
    "grades" = [25,56,85] 
}
(que-5)What is a function in Python? How do you define and call a function?
(Ans-5) A function in python is reusable code of blocks that perform multiple task 
def function_jassi(japreet)
# function body 
# code to be executed 
to define a function in pyrhon you use def keyword 
def greet(name):
    """
    This function greets the person whose name is passed as an argument.
    """
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

(que-6) What are *args and **kwargs in Python functions?
(Ans-6) args allow a function to accept any number (non-keyword arguments)
the arguments are stored in a tuple
  def add_numbers(args)
   '''
   this function given the sum of all numbers passed to it
   '''
      return sum(args)
 add_numbers(10,20,30,40)
 add_numbers(1,5,6)

 **kwargs (Keyword Arguments):
   kwargs allow a function to accept any number of keyword arguments (arguments passes as `key=value`).
   for example
   def print_details(kwargs):
     '''
     this function prints out the details passed to it as keyword arguments.
     '''
     for key , value in kwargs,items():
     print(d"{key}:{value}")

print_details(name="Alice",age=30, city="New york")
print_details(name="Bob", profession="Engineer")

(que-7) Explain the concept of a lambda function with an example.
(Ans-7) a = lambda x,y: x*y
        z = a(5,6)
        print(z)

(que-8) What are exceptions in Python? How do you handle exceptions?
(ans-8) Some common exceptions in python are following
      (1)- ZeroDivisionError
      (2)- TypeError
      (3)- IndexError
      (4)- Keyerror
      (5)-ValueError
      (6)-FileNotFoundError
      Python provides a way to handle exceptions using the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. 

(que-9) What are instance variables and class variables?
      
(Ans-9) Instance variable 
(1) Unique to each object
(2)  defined within method , typically __init__
(3) prefix with self
(4) Different objects can have different values for the same instance variable 
      (Class variable)
(1) shared among all instance of the class 
(2) defined directly in class and outside any method 
(3) access via the class name or any instance  
(4) All objects share the same value for the class variable 

(Que-10)  How you import method in python 
(Ans 10)  from math import sqrt

# Now you can use sqrt directly without prefixing it with math.
result = sqrt(25)
print(result)  

(Que-11) What is the difference between import and from import
(Ans-11) 
Feature	import	                                  from ... import
Imports	The entire module	                      Specific functions, classes, or variables
Access	Must use module_name.function_name	      Can use function_name directly
Verbosity	More verbose	                      Less verbose
Risk of Naming Conflicts	                      Low	Higher (if names overlap)
Code Clarity	High (explicit origins)	          Lower (origin might be less obvious)

(que-12) What is the purpose of the with statement in file handling?
(Ans-12) When you open a file using the `with` statement, Python automatically loses the file when the code of file is executed. This is true even if an exception is raised within the block 

(que-13) What are the different types of sequences in Python?
(Ans-13) list,tuple,string,rangegs,bytes,bytearray,Memoryview

(que-14) How do you add and remove elements from a list?
(Ans-14)  To Add elements in a list 
        1) append method 
        2) extend method 
        3) insert method 

(que-15) What are list comprehensions? Provide an example.
(Ans-15) List comprehensions in Python provide a concise way to create lists. They are a powerful and flexible tool that allows you to generate new lists by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable (like a list or range) and optionally filtering items based on a condition.
[expression for item in iterable if condition] 
    code 
    squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
